# Employee Performance Data System (SQL)

This is a small, focused SQL project built to manage and analyze employee data. It includes runnable query scripts and a PDF report with solved questions and outputs. The goal is simple: write clear SQL and turn raw HR data into useful, decision-ready insights.

## What’s inside
- **queries.sql** – All queries used to answer real use cases (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, aggregates, filters).
- **Employee_Tracking_Performance.pdf** – Screenshots/results of executed queries (solved questions).
- *(Optional)* Excel data files used for testing.

## What it shows
- Department-wise employee details
- Leave patterns by type
- Attendance and payroll lookups
- Quick checks for high performers / high salary cases

## Why this repo
I wanted a clean, practical example that reads like real work: a dataset, questions that matter, and SQL that actually runs. It’s simple, organized, and easy to review for anyone evaluating SQL skills.
